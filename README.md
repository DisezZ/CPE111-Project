Progress
=======================================================================
About the user interface, Overall, it has been displayed where it should
have been had for easy to test the program but it quite not comfortable
to use for the user because now we focussing on debugging of the program.
Thus for the final version of our program we will pay attention more on
the interface that suite for user comfortable experience. 
=======================================================================
About the file system management, the progress of code is more than 60%
it have some problem to find the current directory and open the directory 
but if you run the program and not found the sample database in programe 
it because the problem in find directory function. but other function 
can do it well
